I went there with my friend last saturday.
first it took us a long time to find the place.
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers.
but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi.

I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni. (

I sometimes see the waiters don't have enough knowledge of their dishes.
But they do.
(that is A MUST, but not every restaurant can do...)
If you want to dine with large party, I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT.
There's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).##nice - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,small - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,

This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.##good - FOOD#QUALITY +1,inexpensive - FOOD#PRICES +1,
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.##huge - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS +1,best - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.##good - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.##limited - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS -1,
In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.

First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.##romantic - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,
Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.
The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.##close - AMBIENCE#GENERAL -1,typical - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS -1,overpriced - DRINKS#PRICES -1,
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.##above average - DRINKS#QUALITY +1,
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.##expect - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,
For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc....
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.##proper - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,
To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.##redeeming - FOOD#QUALITY +1,above average - FOOD#QUALITY +1,deficiencies - RESTAURANT#GENERAL -1,

Good Experience##Good - RESTAURANT#GENERAL +1,
During our trip to NYC, we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the Four Seasons for their pre-theater menu (offering a modified menu for $65 pp).
The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings.##extensive - DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS +1,knowledgeable - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,

Maggot in the food!
I've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table.
The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.##great - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS +1,nice - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,average - FOOD#QUALITY -1,
Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom.
I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).
When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.
Yes, I ate the food, but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating, and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach.
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.
We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food.##well prepared - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.##lack of intelligent - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,

The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!##good - FOOD#QUALITY +1,

I went here for a family birthday dinner. 
Five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a Thursday evening. 
The hostess said "Wow that's a large group, unless you aren't together", to which I replied "no we are, and there will be one more, so a table for six please." 
At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.
The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions.##simple - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS -1,

The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order. 
We replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay. 
She replied "well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded."
We called the other person who was very close by, and she told us to order for her, so we did. 
The food arrived in about 15 minutes.

Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.
I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).
But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food

This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life.
They have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant.
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service.##disgusted - FOOD#QUALITY -1,disgusted - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
For starters they delivered us someone else's order.
Fine, I wont hang you for that.
However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.##mediocre - FOOD#QUALITY -1,disgusting - FOOD#QUALITY -1,
Not one to jump to complaints (hence my lack of previous online reviewing), I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations.
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.
None was made so i hung up.
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.
My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.##disgusted - FOOD#QUALITY -1,
Not only have I worked in restaurants for many years, I am now in culinary school, I am a huge lover of oysters and fish, and my girlfriend is half Korean!
We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish.

We were charged full price.
If you ware looking for Korean fusion, I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village.
Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street, of course.
Lives up to the hype
We've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there.

Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City##Most Romantic - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!##favorite - RESTAURANT#GENERAL +1,most romantic - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate decor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city.##hidden - LOCATION#GENERAL -1,intimate - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,zen - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,
If you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!).##ushered - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,
It’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!##cute - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,
My party had the BBE fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!##wonderful - FOOD#PRICES +1,
I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it.
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.##delightful - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce.
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better.##devoured - FOOD#QUALITY +1,better - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
The entrees were served with miso soup and rice.
The sake complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.##well - DRINKS#QUALITY +1,
For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha powdered green tea and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.##interesting - FOOD#QUALITY +1,extraordinary - FOOD#QUALITY +1,phenomenal - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie.##good - RESTAURANT#GENERAL +1,reasonable - RESTAURANT#PRICES +1,
I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.##quiet - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,unhurried - RESTAURANT#GENERAL +1,memorable - RESTAURANT#GENERAL +1,

We were 10 people celebrtating a birthday, we sat in the tent.
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.
They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks and their pita bread!##rude - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,horrible - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,

Great Shabu Shabu##Great - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
I go here at least once every other week, particularly when it's cold!

To be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu.
I tried a couple other dishes but wasn't too impressed.##impressed - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
But for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.##better - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
In fact there is only one I've tried that even compares (shabu Tatsu) and even then I prefer Dokebi.
The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.##fresh - FOOD#QUALITY +1,great - FOOD#QUALITY +1,free - FOOD#PRICES +1,good - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos.##classic - FOOD#QUALITY +1,

Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money.
This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...##weired - AMBIENCE#GENERAL -1,dizzy - AMBIENCE#GENERAL -1,delusional - AMBIENCE#GENERAL -1,

Dumbfoundingly Poor##Poor - RESTAURANT#GENERAL -1,
This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.##uncomfortable - RESTAURANT#GENERAL -1,
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.##perfected - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,
Polite acknowledgement is out;
supercilious scorn is in.
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?
A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).##enhanced - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,delicious - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.##good - FOOD#QUALITY +1,better - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)##nice - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,attractive - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,reasonable - DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS +1,
At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.
On that scale, it's a world-beater.##world-beater - RESTAURANT#GENERAL +1,
How is this palce still open?
I honestly don't even know where to begin.
My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers, and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms.
We arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy.##happy - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,
We ordered our appetizers, I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon.
Everything was going good until we got our meals.##good - RESTAURANT#GENERAL +1,good - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled.##appalled - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS -1,
It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.##undercooked - FOOD#QUALITY -1,
My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead, while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat.
I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.##fishy - FOOD#QUALITY -1,dry - FOOD#QUALITY -1,bland - FOOD#QUALITY -1,
At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.
So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.##undercooked - FOOD#QUALITY -1,
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.##hidden - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS -1,
I've had better chicken at BBQs!!!!
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.##inedible - FOOD#QUALITY -1,
Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, "oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier" No apology, nothing.
After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!
No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!
I was literally going to explode, but instead, my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager.
This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.##bad - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore.
The level of rudeness was preposterous.##preposterous - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.##enjoy - DRINKS#QUALITY +1,enjoy - FOOD#QUALITY +1,

Moving on.
If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place.
Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian.
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
Well...they can run but they can't hide.
I live in the West Village and I've been to a lot of restaurants.
Sometimes you pay a lot and don't get much in return - it's manhattan, things are expensive.
However, most of them are at least prompt and pleasant.
This place...god where do i begin.
It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.##spectacular - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!##distraction - AMBIENCE#GENERAL -1,cold - FOOD#QUALITY -1,
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.
Great Hot Dogs!##Great - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
I've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby (I live on UWS).
Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.##delivers - FOOD#QUALITY +1,;crowded - RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS -1,

We live nearby BFC. 
It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. ##out - RESTAURANT#PRICES -1,
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return.##fantastic - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,exceptional - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!##abused - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.##frizzy - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night - WTF??
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!##horrified - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,rudely - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about.##uninvited - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. ##nasty - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,personal - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.##upset - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service.##better - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,
So, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first...
Maitre-D-"Eat and get out"

The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.##unwelcoming - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,arrogant - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,fine - FOOD#QUALITY +1,fine - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.##high-end - DRINKS#QUALITY +1,
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.##bad - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.##smug - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,arrogant - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,condescending - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else.
If you go here, do it on his off-night.

There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.
On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.
Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.
Without the wait or attitude, I would probably go back, but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and don't make me jump through hoops.

I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party."

The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.
We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.

I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.##teamed - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.
I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.
