Boot time is super fast, around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute.##fast +1
tech support would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $150 plus.
but in resume this computer rocks!##rocks +1
Set up was easy.##easy +1
Did not enjoy the new Windows 8 and touchscreen functions.##enjoy +1
I expected so as it's an Apple product, but I was glad to see my expectations exceeded, this is THE laptop to buy right now.
Other than not being a fan of click pads (industry standard these days) and the lousy internal speakers, it's hard for me to find things about this notebook I don't like, especially considering the $350 price tag.##lousy -1
excellent in every way.##excellent +1
No installation disk (DVD) is included.
It's fast, light, and simple to use.##fast +1, light +1, simple +1
Works well, and I am extremely happy to be back to an apple OS.##well, happy +1
This mac has been a problem since we got it.
Sure it's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100%.##light +1, slim +1
I am pleased with the fast log on, speedy WiFi connection and the long battery life (>6 hrs).##pleased +1, fast +1, speedy +1, long +1
The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key.
Made interneting (part of my business) very difficult to maintain.##difficult -1
Luckily, for all of us contemplating the decision, the Mac Mini is priced just right.##right +1
Small and still VERY powerful.##Small +1, powerful +1
I had gotten this model for  $1199.00 on my State's tax-free weekend and had a $100 off coupon for a MacBook at the local BestBuy!
Super light, super sexy and everything just works.##light +1, sexy +1
Only problem that I had was that the track pad was not very good for me, I only had a problem once or twice with it, But probably my computer was a bit defective.##good +1, defective -1
And if you are switching from a pc I highly sugest this one.
It is super fast and has outstanding graphics.##fast +1, outstanding +1
But the mountain lion is just too slow.##slow -1
Strong build though which really adds to its durability.##Strong +1
The battery life is excellent- 6-7 hours without charging.##excellent +1
I enjoy having apple products.
I've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly.##perfectly +1
I will never go back to a PC again!
And I may be the only one but I am really liking Windows 8.##liking +1
The baterry is very longer.##longer +1
And it's so quiet that I don't hear it at all.
Its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable.##ideal +1, acceptable +1
I know Apples are more expensive than PCs, but he thinks it is worth every penny.##expensive -1, worth +1
To me it's a workhorse... and quiet as can be... you even save big bucks not dishing out any extra to Uncle Sam... Definite Buy...##quiet +1
I can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied.##satisfied +1
I'm pretty sure when I bought it, my bank account went 'ouch!
Thank you so much for the great item.##great +1
This laptop has only 2 USB ports, and they are both on the same side.
It's annoying very much and I won't ever buy any Acer products.##annoying -1
This is why I purchased a BRAND NEW LAPTOP in the first place so it wouldn't have ANY problems.
It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp.##much more +1, sharp +1
As for the laptop, this is our 3rd Apple computer in the past 2 years.
Everything I wanted and everything I needed and the price was great!##great +1
It's not inexpensive but the Hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small.##inexpensive +1, impressive +1
It is better than my old acer laptop.##better +1
This thing is awesome, everything always works, everything is always easy to set up, everything is compatible, its literally everything I could ask for.##awesome +1, easy +1, compatible +1
I would buy it again in a heartbeat!
Keyboard responds well to presses.##responds well +1
If someone called me an Apple Fanboy it would make sense.
Lastly, Windows 8 is annoying.##annoying -1
A scratch on a $1,500 MacBook is unforgivable.
I just fell in love with this thing.##fell in love +1
Everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure.##easy +1, intuitive +1
I have no problems yet on my mac so far, and hope it stays like that.
This laptop is a great buy.##great +1
Biggest complaint is Windows 8 .##complaint -1
Only 2 usb ports ... seems kind of limited.##limited -1
It has been to early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though.
This device has met my expectations and I'm sure it will meet yours.
It has all the expected features and more +plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard.##wide +1, roomy +1
Out of all the laptops I have owned, this is by far the best!##best +1
Amazing Performance for anything I throw at it.##Amazing +1
I can never go back to a PC now, this machine never freezes or has any problems.
Out of the box I noticed how small it was and was exactly what I was looking for.##small +1
The receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance.##superlatives +1
I was extremely happy with the OS itself.##happy +1
I was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it.
The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months.##great +1
Great purchase and I definitely didn't miss out on the Black Friday deals.##Great +1
The criticism has waned, and now I'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly portable computing.##recommend +1
I would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had Windows 8
MS Office 2011 for Mac is wonderful, well worth it.##wonderful +1, well worth +1
After using it for over a month, an issue started to surface.
But the performance of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment.##disappointment -1
There has been no problem with anything.
I believe with Apple - you get what you pay for.
They don't just look good; they deliver excellent performance.##good +1, excellent +1
I have had it over a year now with out a Glitch of any kind .. I love the lit up keys and screen display ... this thing is Fast and clear as can be.##love +1, Fast +1, clear +1
The product is prefect for everyone.##prefect +1
The Mountain Lion OS is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with Microsoft Windows.##not hard +1
However, I can refute that OSX is "FAST".##FAST +1
I waited to review to make sure it is what it is.
Enjoy using Microsoft Office!##Enjoy +1
I would suggest this product to anyone.
With no problems,  I'm happy with this purchase because I saved money compared to buying it anywhere else.##happy +1
Incredible graphics and brilliant colors.##Incredible +1, brilliant +1
I needed something affordable from Apple and was tired of dealing with PC laptop after PC laptop.
Just bit the bullet and bought the Mac hoping it will last a lot longer….
Built-in apps are purely amazing.##amazing +1
Cons: Screen resolution.
From the speed to the multi touch gestures this operating system beats Windows easily.##beats +1
I really like the size and I'm a fan of the ACERS.##like +1
This is by far the best, most reliable computer I could find.##best +1, reliable +1
I opted for the SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty ($1500-2000) which also support "accidents" like drops and spills that are NOT covered by AppleCare.
It's light and easy to transport.##light +1, easy +1
Once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed Windows 8 Set-Up you may feel frustrated.##poorly designed -1, frustrated -1
Very powerful especially for the money.##powerful +1
When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years, I decided to buy MacBook Pro.
It's been time for a new laptop, and the only debate was which size of the Mac laptops, and whether to spring for the retina display.
This was a significantly more affordable than getting a new MacBook Pro from Apple.
I have always wanted a MacBook Pro always!
The reason why I choose apple MacBook because of their design and the aluminum casing.
The aluminum body sure makes it stand out.
Overall it's an amazing product, 5 stars!##amazing +1, 5 stars +1
It is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices, and USB devices are recognized almost instantly.##easy +1, instantly +1
He's thrilled with his new laptop.##thrilled -1
Amazing product as you would expect from Apple.##Amazing +1
Nothing wrong with this computer at all!##Nothing wrong +1
And the fact that Apple is driving the 13" RMBP with the Intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered (to me.##underpowered -1
I have to wonder why Amazon is even selling this dinosaur.
Apple removed the DVD drive Firewire port (will work with adapter) and put the SDXC slot in a silly position on the back.
No hassle and no complaints.
LOVE IT I've always been an apple fan boy, but never had the money to buy a mac, only ipads and iphones, and this is my first mac, blew me away completely.##LOVE +1
The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money.##worth +1
Well designed and fast.##Well +1, fast +1
And now I am a proud MacBook owner also!
But I was completely wrong, this computer is UNBELIEVABLE amazing and easy to use.##UNBELIEVABLE +1, amazing +1, easy +1
Exactly as posted plus a great value.##great +1
The specs are pretty good too.##good +1
I am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it.
There were no scratches or dents or any marks at all.
I've only had it one day, but I really do love it and I'm happy it was economical and I'm finally able to own a Mac!##love +1, happy +1, economical +1
Since I have always used Apple products, the choice of Macbook Pro was obvious.
Apple is unmatched in product quality,aesthetics,craftmanship, and customer service.##unmatched -1
This is my first apple laptop.
It makes a great gift.##great +1
It is a great size and amazing windows 8 included!##great +1, amazing +1
I would recommend to any one looking for a first class computer!##recommend +1, first class +1
I do not like too much Windows 8.##like +1
Startup times are incredibly long: over two minutes.##long -1
I bought this Macbook Pro from Best Buy under a year ago to replace my old Macbook Air.
The macbook pro is really responsive.##responsive +1
Also stunning colors and speedy##stunning +1, speedy +1
it is really expensive though.##expensive -1
great price free shipping what else can i ask for!!##great +1, free +1
This mouse is terrific.##terrific +1
I will also say it is much better than I expected!##better +1
This computer does everything i need it to do for school and more.
It is really thick around the battery.##thick -1
And windows 7 works like a charm.##charm +1
And I can attach my projector to it.
:) Great product, great price, great delivery, and great service.##Great +1, great +1, great +1, great +1
:] It arrived so fast and customer service was great.##fast +1, great +1
tried windows 8 and hated it !!!##hated -1
The price is higher than most lab top out there; however, he/she will get what they paid for, which is a great computer.##higher -1, great +1
So, I thought why not give Mac Book pro a try.
Set up was a breeze.##breeze +1
But I do NOT like Win8.##like +1
I have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and computers - but this is by far the most superior machine I have ever owned.##superior +1
I am still in the process of learning about its features.
BTW, I checked online regarding the old laptop that 'died' and found that I was not alone, far from it.
I had the same reasons as most PC users: the price, the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games.##overbearing -1, lack -1
I wanted it for it's mobility and man, this little bad boy is very nice.##nice +1
Seems to me that's the best way to get Apple's attention.
Very nice so far.##nice +1
You won't be disappointed.##disappointed -1
The investment of a new MacBook Pro came at a price, but totally worth it for a good piece of mind.##worth +1, good +1
I found the mini to be:Exceptionally easy to set up##easy +1
Having USB3 is why I bought this Mini.
Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it.
The sound is nice and loud; I don't have any problems with hearing anything.##nice +1, loud +1
It is very slim, the track pad is very much impressed with me.##slim +1, impressed +1
This was the same problem with my MacBook (circa 2007) that I just retired.
Great things come in small "packages.##Great +1
HUGE Apple MAC Fan!
Looked at HP, ASUS, Acer, Sony and a bunch of other ones but could not find I really liked.
The settings are not user-friendly either.##user-friendly +1
Honestly, I am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs.
Most of them were either too big, too noisy and too slow after 2 years.##big -1, noisy -1, slow -1
The machine is used, but is like new, i'm very impress.##impress +1
Thank goodness for OpenOffice!
Awesome form factor, great battery life, wonderful UX.##Awesome +1, great +1, wonderful +1
Needless to say, the leap from that to this has been amazing and (aside from the financial reasons) I am astounded that I hadn't made the switch sooner.##amazing +1, astounded +1
Its perfect, not much heavy.##perfect +1, heavy -1
i love the keyboard and the screen.##love +1
I find it not to be very user friendly.##user friendly +1
It has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs.
However, there are MAJOR issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless.##issues -1, useless -1
What angers me more than anything else is that I spent all those years hating MACs when I could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief!
I've already upgraded o Mavericks and I am impressed with everything about this computer.##impressed +1
So this is very good computer and i highly suggest it.##good +1
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been.
I was going to buy today and noticed it went back up to $344.99?
Not as fast as I would have expect for an i5.##fast +1
SO of course this one came through with the awesomeness!
You will not regret buying this computer!
Nothing bad to say about it.##Nothing bad +1
It s heavy for Mac book but is good.##heavy -1, good +1
thanks for great service and shipping!##great +1
Deal of the year.
My sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason.
Minis make sense for a lot of people.
The performance seems quite good, and built-in applications like iPhoto work great with my phone and camera.##good +1, great +1
This Mac Mini makes the Macbook Pro seem slow.##slow -1
I did swap out the hard drive for a Samsung 830 SSD which I highly recommend.##recommend +1
I bought this MacBook Pro to replace my six-year-old PC (a Sony Vaio), but it was basically no better than my old PC, so I returned it.
I wanted a simple, reliable  laptop.##simple +1, reliable +1
Cheaper than buying it @ apple too!##Cheaper +1
I have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer.
Extremely disappointed with the way it is.##disappointed -1
Never been happier using  computer.
I have had a total of 5 different laptop from many different manufactures.
Does everything I wanted this laptop to do.
Besides, the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales.##lack -1
Turns out this is a common problem.
Starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go.
It is also fast as can be... you get what you pay for... well worth the investment##fast +1, well worth +1
But I'm still learning so can't rate it yet for everything.
Overall very impressed, Thank you Apple and Amazon!##impressed +1
Yes, that's a good thing, but it's made from aluminum that scratches easily.##good +1, scratches easily -1
Very fast for my needs.##fast +1
I bought this Mac in order to replace my old Dell laptop.
Quick and has built in virus control.##Quick +1
Took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without.
I saw the Mini Mac at Best Buy and decided to get this as my replacement.
I finally decided on this one and couldn't be any happier.
I was also informed that the components of the Mac Book were dirty.##dirty -1
So glad I did not waste money on a less than par product.
Haven't regretted it one bit.
The one thing that Apple does right is computers.
the hardware problems have been so bad, i can't wait till it completely dies in 3 years, TOPS!##bad -1
It's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion!##nice +1, long +1
I think that they are the best out on the market.##best +1
HOWEVER I chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive.
That's quite a bump up from the $599 that this little guy sells for, which leaves me to my next point.
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands.##smooth +1, heavy -1
My laptop is so light that I can take it with me anywhere.##light +1
it's exactly what i wanted, and it has all the new features and whatnot.
You can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish.##fast +1, stylish +1
Finally decided to try a MAC because there were too many choices of which PC's to buy and EVERYONE who had a MAC said "buy a MAC".
Can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a MacBook?
It feels cheap, the keyboard is not very sensitive.##cheap -1, sensitive +1
That defeated the whole point of a laptop.
Though please note that sometimes it crashes, and the sound quality isnt superb.##crashes -1, superb +1
It is very easy to navigate even for a novice.##easy +1
But until now, no complains at all.
The cons are more annoyances that can be lived with.
Does everything I need it to, has a wonderful battery life and I couldn't be happier.##wonderful +1
Great Performance and Quality.##Great +1
Just What I Needed For Portable And My Wallet Too!
The device speaks about it self.
I used windows XP, windows Vista, and Windows 7 extensively.
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously RIGHT after i bought this one.
it does get hot when using on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a desk ... this is in an un-air conditioned room in air condition it gets slightly warm......##hot -1
I did add a SSD drive and memory
I got this one for thanks giving Offer for $962 :).
I had my PC laptop for 3 years and going to a MacBook Pro is like I leaped through time.
On start up it asks endless questions just so itunes can sell you more of their products.
Pretty much made sense to get a Mini.
I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new OS.
not something you want to miss out on!!!
One more thing, this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC's, also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables.
I bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design.
I previously owned an older Dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years.
Its a pretty decent computer.##decent +1
I never tried any external mics with that iMac.
The new os is great on my macbook pro!##great +1
It was fast, and it was "different".##fast +1, different +1
I had a little problem adjusting to the small screen but works fine as long as I remember to carry my glasses.##problem -1, small -1
I purchased my first Mac and am glad I did.##glad +1
I have experienced no problems, works as anticipated.
System is running great.##great +1
Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks.##Easy +1
They really screwed the pooch on this one.
The MAC Mini, wireless keyboard / mouse and a HDMI cable is all I need to get some real work done.
I finally pulled the trigger and I am blown away by how much more I enjoy my computer tasks using the Mac Mini!!!##enjoy +1
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good, working well so far.##good +1, well +1
I work as a designer and coder and I needed a new buddy to work with, not gaming.
I was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure.
The new operating system makes this computer into a super iPad.##super +1
I am very happy with my first Mac.##happy +1
Easy to set up and go!##Easy +1
I can't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up.##quiet +1, quick +1
The only issue came when I tried scanning to the mac.
The machine is speedy and efficient.##speedy +1, efficient +1
I think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point.##good +1
A *big* upgrade from my 13" 2006 macbook.
It's just what we were looking for and it works great.##great +1
Having a Mac certainly makes life easier.##easier +1
It's so quick and responsive that it makes working/surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable!##quick +1, responsive +1, pleasurable +1
The old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while.
It works fine, and all the software seems to run pretty well.##fine +1, well +1
For this purpose, it's great.##great +1
Couldn't have asked for more!
I'm using this computer for word processing, web browsing, some gaming, and I'm learning programming.
It certainly does, but you rarely hear any of your friends with Mac's complain about anything.
My wife was so excited to open the box, but quickly came to see that it did not function as it should.
I don't have any technical pearls to share.
I wanted a computer that was quite, fast, and that had overall great performance.##fast +1, great +1
Apple "Help" is a mixed bag.
All I can say is I am impressed.##impressed +1
It suddenly can not work.
It did everything we expected!
Harddrive was in poor condition, had to replace it.##poor -1
The on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner.##obscure -1
It's a nice little gadget.##nice +1
My only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini.##lack -1
The only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming, otherwise the integrated Intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks.##good +1, well +1
It's macbook pro and there is no discussion about it.
I'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple.
I use it mostly for content creation (Audio, video, photo editing) and its reliable.##reliable +1
It is the best all around Mac.##best +1
Screen is bright and gorgeous.##bright +1, gorgeous +1
Also is portable and reliable.##portable +1, reliable +1
The only solution is to turn the brightness down, etc.
It is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but I am very satisfied.##satisfied +1
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications.
It is robust, with a friendly use as all Apple products.##robust +1, friendly +1
Even if you don't do business, thats okay, it's incredibly fast.##fast +1
It is fast and easy to use.##fast +1, easy +1
This was absolutely annoying!##annoying -1
And the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up##speeds things up +1
But for those of you that dont have a mac and are still on the PC's this is a good foot in the door into mac.##good +1
I have been PC for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help##intuitive +1, great +1
and it fits in my briefcase with ease##ease +1
Nice screen, keyboard works great!##Nice +1, great +1
Still not bad for 220.00.
I was amazed at how fast the delivery was.##amazed +1, fast +1
Good computer and fast.##Good +1, fast +1
I've installed to it additional SSD and 16Gb RAM.
The memory was gone and it was not able to be used.##gone -1
Its pretty much fire it up and go.
It works great and I am so happy I bought it.##great +1, happy +1
Let me start off by saying that I was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop.##reluctant -1
I like the design and ease of use with the keyboard, plenty of ports.##like +1, ease +1, plenty +1
Apple is living up to its name with the mini and, for our needs, it's perfect.##perfect +1
it definitely beats my old mac and the service was great.##great +1
I went from a Macbook to this Mac Mini and this was a great upgrade!##great +1
Web browsing is very quick with Safari browser.##quick +1
It couldn't have been a better decision.
I like the lighted screen at night.##like +1
It's great to have a solid Mac in the living room.##great +1, solid +1
It is really easy to use and it is quick to start up.##easy +1, quick +1
I've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts.##slow -1
Very light and easily maneuverable.##light +1, easily maneuverable +1
USB3 Peripherals are noticably less expensive than the ThunderBolt ones.##less expensive +1
This can be annoying at first but you just have to train yourself not to to start over so far.
And mine had broke but I sent it in under warranty - no problems.
I am not happy with my purchase
It's fast, light, and is perfect for media editing, which is mostly why I bought it in the first place.##fast +1, light +1, perfect +1
However, the machine itself left a bit to be desired.
The battery lasts as advertised (give or take 15-20 minutes), and the entire user experience is very elegant.##elegant +1
I spent months looking for a good laptop for me and I finally found it!##good +1
$999.00 Tax free.
Thanks for the fast shipment and great price.##fast +1, great +1
!Excellent performance, usability, presentation and time response.##Excellent +1
The smaller size was a bonus because of space restrictions.##smaller +1
I blame the Mac OS.##blame -1
But for now, this laptop is still a workhorse.
In fact I still use many Legacy programs (Appleworks, FileMaker Pro, Quicken, Photoshop etc)!
It's small but powerful, light but strong, elegant and beautiful... In resume: it's a Mac!##small +1, powerful +1, light +1, strong +1, elegant +1, beautiful +1
I like the operating system.##like +1
I wish I would have taken the plunge years ago.
I love the form factor.##love +1
I haven't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review.
It's fast at loading the internet.##fast +1
So much faster and sleeker looking.##faster +1, sleeker +1
I plan on using my MacBook Pro for a long time.
Unfortunately, it runs XP and Microsoft is dropping support next April.
Its seen in movies, sitcoms, prominent important people carry and use them and they are GREAT!##GREAT +1
First off, I really do like my MBP... once used to the OS it is pretty easy to get around, and the overall build is great... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on.##like +1, easy +1, great +1, best +1
Does exactly what I bought it 4.
Buy the Mac Mini it's a terribly great machine.##great +1
It is made of such solid construction and since I have never had a Mac using my iPhone helped me get used to the system a bit.##solid +1
I love this piece of equipment, It will be hard to go back to other type of laptop after using a MacBook Pro.##love +1
Very nice unibody construction.##nice +1
Very disappointed with Apple.##disappointed -1
This Macbook Pro is fast, powerful, and runs super quiet and cool.##fast +1, powerful +1, quiet +1, cool +1
***The review below is no longer relevant, Apple has fixed the issue.
It's ok but doesn't have a disk drive which I didn't know until after I bought it.##ok +1
There is no HDMI receptacle, nor is there an SD card slot located anywhere on the device.
It really is very light compared to other computers.##light +1
It came in brand new and works perfectly.##perfectly +1
This machine is Amazing.##Amazing +1
It shouldn't happen like that, I don't have any design app open or anything.
MY TRACKPAD IS NOT WORKING.##NOT WORKING -1
I just hope this expensive laptop doesn't go dead like my friends ... it did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust.
Considering another computer should be out of the question
It looks and feels solid, with a flawless finish.##solid +1, flawless +1
Its worth every Penny.##worth +1
Price was higher when purchased on MAC when compared to price showing on PC when I bought this product.##higher -1
This was a great deal for a decked out MacBook Pro.##great +1
Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off.
Get this instead, you won't be sorry.
The configuration is perfect for my needs.##perfect +1
and the speakers is the worst ever.##worst -1
I think it was around 16 hundred bucks last I checked.
Its the best, its got the looks, super easy to use and love all you can do with the trackpad!..##best +1, easy +1, love +1
It's fast, quiet, incredibly small and affordable compared to other Mac models.##fast +1, quiet +1, small +1, affordable +1
Web surfing is smooth and seamless.##smooth +1, seamless +1
It was so exciting for me to unwrap my new mac.
I'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product.##pleased +1
so when I had the money to buy one I bought other things instead ... a 700 laptop and some extra stuff with it.
This item is a beautiful piece, it works well, it is easy to carry and handle.##beautiful +1, well +1, easy +1
See retired recently and decided that she wanted a laptop.
It was also suffering from hardware (keyboard) issues, relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime.##issues -1, slow -1, shortening -1
I'm no regular customer I hate wasting my time with hellos and how can I help you's.
Runs good and does the job, can't complain about that!##good +1
It's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk.##silent +1, small +1
I have nothing to regret from this new product.##nothing to regret +1
The exterior is absolutely gorgeous.##gorgeous +1
Have one myself and Love it!##Love +1
It has a very high performance, just for what I needed for.##high +1
This is especially disheartening when Apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals.##disheartening -1
Apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset.##defective -1
Stop living in the stone age and buy a mac, you will not be sorry at all!!
OSX Mountain Lion  soon to upgrade to Mavericks.
Apple hit a home run here.
I just bought the new MacBook Pro, the 13" model, and I can't believe Apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to USB ports.
So glad I have gone this route!!
It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid.
It is the perfect size and speed for me.##perfect +1
I am so addict to this laptop.##addict +1
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIFIC!!##TERRIFIC +1
Trashed it when I spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe.
My last laptop was a 17" ASUS gaming machine, which performed admirably, but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life, I found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome, not to mention that the ASUS had been slowly developing problems ever since I bought it about 4 years ago.##admirably +1, problems -1
However, it did not have any scratches, ZERO battery cycle count (pretty surprised), and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly.##surprised +1, ZERO +1, perfectly +1
After fumbling around with the OS I started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue.
I couldn't be more pleased.##pleased +1
And as for all the fancy finger swipes -- I just gave up and attached a mouse.
I needed a laptop with big storage, a nice screen and fast so I can photoshop without any problem.##big +1, nice +1, fast +1
I like coming back to Mac OS but this laptop is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $400  old HP laptop.##lacking -1
It is much better than the Acer ultrabook I had before.##better +1
Shipped very quickly and safely.##quickly +1, safely +1
I finally own a piece of computing equipment that I don't want to take a baseball bat and destroy.
The thunderbolt port is awesome!##awesome +1
User friendly, fast and high tech  It is amazing!##User friendly +1, fast +1, high tech +1, amazing +1
The performance is definitely superior to any computer I've ever put my hands on.##superior +1
It's great for streaming video and other entertainment uses.##great +1
Apple did a great job.##great +1
I like the design and its features but there are somethings I think needs to be improved.##like +1
There were small problems with Mac office.
It is extremely fast and very compact.##fast +1, compact +1
I understand I should call Apple Tech Support about any variables(which is my purpose of writing this con) as variables could be a bigger future problem.
I ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with spec of the new 27" Imacs.##disappointed -1
It still works and it's extremely user friendly, so I would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things##user friendly +1, recommend +1, efficient +1
Its fast, easy to use and it looks great.##fast +1, easy +1, great +1
(but Office can be purchased) IF I ever need a laptop again I am for sure purchasing another Toshiba!!
I haven't tried the one with retina display... Maybe in the future.
You can read all about the details of this marvelous computer on wikipedia.##marvelous +1
Performance is much much better on the Pro, especially if you install an SSD on it.##better +1
Note, however, that any existing MagSafe accessories you have will not work with the MagSafe 2 connection.
If you get a lemon (I have two thirds of my  Macs), you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it, even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers.
The only thing I dislike is the touchpad, alot of the times its unresponsive and does things I dont want it too, I would recommend using a mouse with it.##dislike -1, unresponsive -1, recommend +1
Yeah, it's super expensive.##expensive -1
The Mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and runs very quiet, actually the fans aren't audible unlike my old pc##smaller +1, quiet +1, audible -1
MAYBE The Mac OS improvement were not The product they Want to offer.
It came before the day it supposed to which is great.##great +1
I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new Mac ecosystem.
It's absolutely wonderful and worth the price!##wonderful +1, worth +1
It's a good fix, in my opinion.##good +1
I am please with the products ease of use; out of the box ready; appearance and functionality.##ease +1, out of the box +1
Buying a Mac Mini would allow me to make the transition.
Before I begin, I will say that I am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - I am not an Apple fanboy.
its by far faster and more stable then my PC.##faster +1, more stable +1
I purchased a MacBook Pro and this to replace a couple of HP units that I was using.
you will not regret it, promise you!
Moving from a PC to Mac has never been easier, and I'm glad that I did it.##glad +1
Perfect for all my graphic design classes I'm taking this year in college :-)##Perfect +1
Have used only Macs for years.
Being a tech savvy, APPLE - product loving person, I'm glad I finally got the MacBook Pro!##glad +1
I was always against them but now I buying one I'll never go back to PC.
I will not be using that slot again.
I think that was a great decision to buy##great +1
The OS is fast and fluid, everything is organized and it's just beautiful.##fast +1, fluid +1, organized +1, beautiful +1
It will make life so much easier next semester, just wish I had it last semester!!##easier +1
I paid for a new laptop, but was sent a used one.
Searched it on amazon and on bestbuy.
I bought this one for my 11 year old and the MacBook Air for my 9 year old.
I bought it for college and so far it's amazing!##amazing +1
They are simpler to use.##simpler +1
It was at my door in less than 24 hours.
It's also very pricey but you just have to tell yourself it's an investment and that it's gonna last you a long time.##pricey -1
It was getting old and I needed a new school computer.
!so nice .. stable .. fast .. now i got my SSD !##nice +1, stable +1, fast +1
I love apple but unlike others That does not prevent me to not be honest about how i like it and if its good or not.##love +1
So, I'm cooled on Mac buys.
It is a great computer for that and I have to say I'm happy I switched.##great +1, happy +1
Also, in using the built-in camera, my voice recording for my vlog sounds like the interplanetary transmissions in the "Star Wars" saga.
Overall a nice computer.##nice +1
You can imagine that an expensive item as a laptop will not be left on your front steps, it needs signature to pove that you received it.
I love the quick start up.##love +1
Yes, he is a self professed "Mac snob.
You just cannot beat the functionality of an Apple device.##cannot beat +1
Yet my mac continues to function properly.##properly +1
Graphics are much improved.##improved +1
Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase:Build Quality - Seriously, you can't beat a unibody construction.##confident +1
It's the mid 2012 version.
It provides much more flexibility for connectivity.##more +1
I want the portability of a tablet, without the limitations of a tablet and that's where this laptop comes into play.
I have had many, many issues with PC's in the past and I'm finally glad to have joined the Mac revolution!##glad +1
Mac tutorials do help.##help +1
When it broke I wanted another Acer and chose the V5.
The technical support was not helpful as well.##helpful +1
I got the new adapter and there was no change.
so i called technical support.
Nothing about it that i don't love, apple always makes a great product.##love +1, great +1
I saved about $100 plus tax ordering on Amazon and since I have prime, it arrived overnight for just $3.99 more.
Came with iPhoto and garage band already loaded.
It's all a bit magical.##magical +1
Logic board utterly fried, cried, and laid down and died.##utterly fried -1
It is BLAZING fast!##fast +1
The sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results.##crappy -1
ive never had a problem with it!
I currently own a Lenovo laptop as well as my new MacBook Pro, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses.
OSX Lion is a great performer..extremely fast and reliable.##great +1, fast +1, reliable +1
Best commuter I have ever owned.##Best +1
What can I say, It's an Apple.
Having heard from friends and family about how reliable a Mac product is, I never expected to have an application crash within the first month, but I did.##crash -1
The Macbook pro's physical form is wonderful.##wonderful +1
I have an iPhone, and iPad, so it just made sense to finish off the platform by adding the Mini.
Not super light but still a good one.##light +1, good +1
The Mini's body hasn't changed since late 2010- and for a good reason.##good +1
The unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than Apple's previous laptops.##solid +1
i had to return it for a replacement.
It was wonderful deal for the wonderful product.##wonderful +1, wonderful +1
It completely supports my home business and personal life.
3D rendering slows it down considerably.##slows it down -1
Got this Mac Mini with OS X Mountain Lion for my wife.
I am pleased to report that it is one of the best presents I have received to date.##pleased +1, best +1
Every day I had this computer, something failed on it.##failed -1
fast, great screen, beautiful apps for a laptop;priced at 1100 on the apple website;amazon had it for 1098+ tax -  plus i had a 10% off coupon from amazon-cost me 998 plus tax- 1070- OTD!##fast +1, great +1, beautiful +1
12.44 seconds to boot.
All the ports are much needed since this is my main computer.
The Like New condition of the iMac MC309LL/A on Amazon is at $900+ level only, and it is a Quad-Core 2.5 GHz CPU (similar to the $799 Mini), with Radeon HD 6750M 512MB graphic card (this mini is integrated Intel 4000 card), and it even comes with wireless Apple Keyboard and Mouse, all put together in neat and nice package.##neat +1, nice +1
Put a cover on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint.##complaint -1
Within a few hours I was using the gestures unconsciously.
This mac does come with an extender cable and I'm using mine right now hoping the cable will stay nice for the many years I plan on using this mac.
This is the third in a series of MacBooks starting with a Black MacBook.
The 2.9ghz dual-core i7 chip really out does itself.
My life has been enriched since I have been using Apple products.##enriched +1
i FINALLY DID IT AND THIS MACHINE IS THE WAY TO GO!
It is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me.##snappy +1, good +1
The few things that are wrong with it are very minor things.
So noise is reduced at least 50% and the heat is much better, now it doesn't feel hot but warm.##reduced +1, better +1
Not sure on Windows 8.
It's a lottery at this point as I have read that other have received new ones with the same problem.
My one complaint is that there was no internal CD drive.##complaint -1
This newer netbook has no hard drive or network lights.
This is the first time for me to use a Mac and I'm really happy with the move.##happy +1
No complaints for an Apple product.
The new MacBook is light-years ahead of my old white plastic MacBook circa 2006.
I would say that 85% of the design industry is Mac for good reason.
I was having a though time deciding between the 13" MacBook Air or the MacBook Pro 13" (Both baseline models, priced at 1,200 $ retail)
The last new mac I bought was in 1998.
There are reviews that speak to a few possible glitches but, I haven't seen them yet.
Not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports.##expense -1, enough +1
I am very satisfied with the mini.##satisfied +1
The audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity.##low -1, unusable -1
I am going to college next year and I needed a cheaper, quality computer for the goals I am trying to pursue.
In the short time of one month since the 2012 Mac Mini was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising.
It is lightweight and the perfect size to carry to class.##lightweight +1, perfect +1
If you have to ask you don't own a Mac and your just not in the know.
All my devises “talk” to each other.
Why not 5 stars?
Very Very Highly Recommended.##Recommended +1
?I am only interested in the 15.4  McBook Pro  Model # MD103LL/A
I don't know why I didn't make the switch sooner ... o ya because it's expensive.##expensive -1
I was given a demonstration of Windows 8.
The Macbook Pro is the premier choice for college students.##premier +1
Their products, including the MBP, are beautiful, sleek and clever.##beautiful +1, sleek +1, clever +1
The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities.##beautiful +1, wonderful +1
I thought that it will be fine, if i do some settings.
Runs very smoothly.##smoothly +1
Perfect--thanks so.##Perfect +1
Also, it hardly ever crashes.##hardly ever crashes +1
I was so excited to get this in the mail i nearly gave myself a heart attack.
Boot-up slowed significantly after all Windows updates were installed.##slowed significantly -1
More likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution.
When i finally held it in my hands i kissed it, yes i did.
It was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet, word processing, graphic design and gaming.##powerful +1
This computer is not cheap and represent an achievement for me.
I like the Mini Mac it was easy to setup and install, but I am learning as I go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features I was use to on the PC especially the right mouse click menu.##easy +1
GET THIS MACHINE
It's shiny and it's pretty.##shiny +1, pretty +1
Runs real quick.##quick +1
All the above aside this machine ROCKS!##ROCKS +1
Buy the separate RAM memory and you will have a rocket!
Since the machine's slim profile is critical to me, that was a problem.##slim +1
Bottom line, if you can afford it, get a Mac!
I finally made the leap after my Gateway crapped out on me.
WiFi capability, disk drive and multiple USB ports to connect scale and printers was all that was required.
The SD card reader is slightly recessed and upside down (the nail slot on the card cannot be accessed), if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue, but its not.##recessed -1, upside down -1
Soft touch, anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws.##Soft +1
Simple details, crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden, bulky sticker filled laptops.##Simple +1, crafted +1
First of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum .##nice +1
Who makes a laptop that can't rest on your lap?
After all was said and done, I essentially used that $450 savings to buy 16GB of RAM, TWO Seagate Momentus XT hybrid drives and an OWC upgrade kit to install the second hard drive.
The Dell Inspiron is fast and has a number pad on the keyboard, which I miss on my Apple laptops.##fast +1
wow the new macbook pro hanged as i tried to type this review.
The MacBook Pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer.##great +1
I was concerned that the downgrade to the regular hard drive would make it unacceptably slow but I need not have worried - this machine is the fastest I have ever owned...##fastest +1
This one still has the CD slot.
No HDMI port.
I had to install Mountain Lion and it took a good two hours.##good +1
Customization on mac is impossible.##impossible -1
I hope this review helps.
However, you have to adjust yourself to what it will do, not what you want it to do.
I am replacing the HD with a Micron SSD soon.
Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive.##intuitive +1
Far superior to my MacBook.##superior +1
The SuperDrive is quiet.##quiet +1
It was quite easy.##easy +1
The power plug has to be connected to the power adaptor to charge the battery but won't stay connected.
I decided to buy a few notebooks for my nephews for Xmas.
The battery was completely dead, in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside.##dead -1
This is no exception.
if yo like practicality this is the laptop for you.##like +1
The OS is great.##great +1
I have had a black macbook since 2007.
I tried several monitors and several HDMI cables and this was the case each time.
CONS: Price is a bit ridiculous, kinda heavy.##ridiculous -1, heavy -1
If that is the case, then I am completely happy##happy +1
10/10 five stars would recommend.##five stars +1, recommend +1
The troubleshooting said it was the AC adaptor so we ordered a new one.
I fell in love with my machine, and it was pampered.##fell in love +1
Fan only comes on when you are playing a game.
Which it did not have, only 3 USB 2 ports.
No startup disk was not included but that may be my fault.
There is no "tools" menu.
It is very fast and has everything that I need except for a word program.##fast +1
Needs a CD/DVD drive and a bigger power switch.
It is the best laptop ever!!!##best +1
My laptop with Windows 7 crashed and I did not want Windows 8.##crashed -1
Was skeptical about buying an electronic item online but it turned out to be a positive experience.
Not a scratch or mark on it.
Easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for ADSl cable or wifi.##Easy +1, small +1, easy +1
Words cannot express how much I love my new Mac.##love +1
The speakers could have been better but it wasn't a deal breaker... this is a great little laptop... love it!##better +1, great +1, love +1
The item received was exactly as identified.
Its everything mac offers.
Nice packing.##Nice +1
Besides being elegant, the MacBooks are durable.##elegant +1, durable +1
I switched to this because I wanted something different, even though I miss windows.
Yes, the MBP is more expensive than competing PC laptops.##expensive -1
Apple no longer includes iDVD with the computer and furthermore, Apple doesn't even offer it anymore!
I also wanted Windows 7, which this one has.
At first, I feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the Mac system.##uncomfortable -1
I am used to computers with windows so I am having a little difficulty finding my way around.
They replaced it and so far so good.##good +1
It just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the OS.##out of the box +1, cool +1
Good in every aspect.##Good +1
its as advertised on here..... it works great and is not a waste of money!##great +1
Replaced this one with my mac that was stolen, its a great computer.##great +1
Just be careful; you always have to give up some good stuff for others.
Runs like a champ.....
Really great ... Well let me start at the beginning.##great +1
Premium price for the OS more than anything else.##Premium +1
This was a gift for my grand son.
I was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews, but I've found it fine to work with.##fine +1
I bought this Mac book pro along with a new 27" iMac and while they are still light years more reliable than a PC I have noticed a decline in the reliability of my Mac computers.
The sound as mentioned earlier isn't the best, but it can be solved with headphones.##best +1
The track pad is a bit squirrely at times- sometimes too sensitive, and sometimes a bit unresponsive, but it's usable.##squirrely -1, too sensitive -1, unresponsive -1, usable +1
However, the experience was great since the OS does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen.##great +1, unstable -1
Then only FOUR months later, my great MacBook pro FAILED.##FAILED -1
If you ask me, for this price it should be included.
The battery is not as shown in the product photos.
Even though I could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price I still think there's nothing like a Mac.
Seems a much more economical way to get into Apple than their other computers.##economical +1
Shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more...##quick +1
I'm so disgusted that I wasted my money on this product.##disgusted -1, wasted -1
All you get is a box and a computer.
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping.
Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i've had it.
The Mac Mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there.##simplest +1
Instead, I'll focus more on the actual performance and feature set of the hardware itself so you can make an educated decision on which Mac to buy.
My bag just got a little lighter.##lighter +1
I'm Not exaggerating when I say this computer is perfect ... It is!!##perfect +1
This machine is flawless, fast, and classy.##flawless +1, fast +1, classy +1
Other ports include FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, MagSafe port, Microphone jack.
I stayed up half the night enjoying my new MacBook Pro.##enjoying +1
This laptop is a 100 times better than a Chromebook!##better +1
Additionally, there is barely a ventilation system in the computer, and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot, and in fact impossible to keep on lap.##barely -1, hot -1, impossible -1
At $1899 to start, this is no cheap machine.
Chatting with Acer support, I was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files.##corrupted -1
It's been a couple weeks since the purchase and I'm struggle with finding the correct keys (but that was expected).
Many people complain about the new OS, and it's urgent for Apple to fix it asap!##complain -1
Now that I have upgraded to Lion I am much happier about MAC OS and have just bought an iMac for office.##happier +1
User upgradeable RAM and HDD.##upgradeable +1
But I wanted the Pro for the CD/DVD player.
I might have read it incorrectly, but better safe than sorry right?
The ultimate graduation gift.
The RAM memory is good but should have splurged for 8Mb instead of 4Mb.##good +1
was debating to buy one for months, checked out different stuff on youtube, and read different articles and debates,I just didnt really wanna spend the money but Im glad that I did.
I love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention PC's require.##love +1, recommend +1
I was a little worry at first because I don't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows.
I am an Info Sys major in college, so I started researching this issue on my own.
Solution: it turned out to be pretty simple.
With the softwares supporting the use of other OS makes it much better.##better +1
Still haven't solved this.
I then upgraded to Mac OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion".
It is EXTREMELY fast and never lags.##fast +1, never lags +1
I told them that I just received my brand new MacBook but I was having issues.##issues -1
I was considering buying the Air, but in reality, this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient, even though it's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier.##powerful +1, convenient +1, thicker -1, heavier -1
At home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24" LCD screen, so built in screen size is not terribly important.
Hopefully my replacement is brand new.
Just beware no DVD slot so when I went to install software I had on CD I couldn't.
I bought it to be able to dedicate a small, portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that I needed to buy a word processing program to do so.##small +1, portable +1, surprised -1
This version of MacBook Pro runs on a third-generation CPU ("Ivy Bridge"), not the latest fourth-generation Haswell CPU the 2013 version has.
Actually, I think I was intimidated by the change from a PC.
No Cd Rom in the new version there's no way I'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version.##less -1
Definitely worth spending the money on it.##worth +1
I have three words: Piece of Junk!
the volume is really low to low for a laptop was not expecting volume to be so low and i hate that about this computer##low -1, hate -1
Fits all my personal needs.##Fits +1
I'm the pro-active type so I went off and did some preventative fixes.
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it.##recommend +1
I wanted to explore what the Mac was all about.
I got this at an amazing price from Amazon and it arrived just in time.##amazing +1
Every time I log into the system after a few hours, there is this endlessly frustrating process that I have to go through.##frustrating -1
The majority of the reviews seem to be for the 13.3 MacBook Pro  Model # MD101LL/A.
Put a SSD and use a 21" LED screen, this set up is silky smooth!##silky smooth +1
I saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from Apple and I was concerned but I took my chances and am overly impressed.##impressed +1
The case is now slightly larger than the previous generation, but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size.##larger -1, lack -1
I had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it, as I am old school and hate the pad, but knew that before I bought it, now it works great, need to get adjusted to the key board, as I am used to a bigger one and pounding.##hate -1, great +1
When considering a Mac, look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag.
Has all the other features I wanted including a VGA port, HDMI, ethernet and 3 USB ports.
A great college tool!##great +1
The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip.##dislike -1
I called apple and no solution.
It's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time.##decent +1
I was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon.com than it was in the Mac store.##happy +1, better +1
The worst a Mac ever did to me was freeze up.##worst -1, freeze up -1
The nicest  part is the low heat output and ultra quiet operation.##nicest +1, quiet +1
I am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet.
NO STAR FOR THIS TRASH.[...
I will upgrade the ram myself (because with this model you can you can do it) later on.
The price is 200 dollars down.
this Mac Mini does not have a built-in mic, and it would seem that its Mac OS 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly.
A lot of features and shortcuts on the MBP that I was never exposed to on a normal PC.
Wasn't sure if I was going to like it much less love it so I went to a local best buy and played around with the IOS system on a Mac Pro and it was totally unique and different.##unique +1, different +1
Quietest laptop I have ever owned.##Quietest +1
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small.##higher +1, small -1
again this is just my personal honest opinion.
If you have much higher expectations than that... I would look elsewhere.
working with Mac is so much easier, so many cool features.##easier +1, cool +1
I'm going to buy a logitech c270.
Very happy with my purchase.##happy +1
I like the brightness and adjustments.##like +1
I'M SO HAPPY WITH MY macbook pro!##HAPPY +1
I only wish this mac had a CD/DVD player built in.##wish -1
The only thing I miss is that my old Alienware laptop had backlit keys.##miss -1
The only thing I miss are the "Home/End" type keys and other things that I grew accustomed to after so long.##miss -1
So happy with this purchase, I just wish it came with Microsoft Word.##happy +1
It is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student.##more than enough +1
It has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop.##enough +1
The speed, the simplicity, the design.. it is light-years ahead of any PC I have ever owned.
I love everything about this computer.##love +1
I found it toughest to decide between Dell ultra books and Apple.
The battery life is excellent, the display is excellent, and downloading apps is a  breeze.##excellent +1, excellent +1, breeze +1
The screen, the software and the smoothness of the operating system.
While we struggle with all the crashes and viruses, the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for business!##consistent +1
I don't want to RUN a computer; I want to USE a computer.
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it.
I also made a recovery USB stick.
Being a PC user for many years to switch to a Mac I will not go back.
But with this laptop, the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny.##weak -1, tinny -1
I do admit it is pricey but the saying is really true with this MacBook Pro Laptop ( You get what you pay for).##pricey -1
I've almost have bought every generation of MacMinis since 2005, and this one hasn't let me down.
The built quality is really good, I was so Happy and excited about this Product.##good +1, Happy +1, excited +1
I am loving the fast performance also.##loving +1, fast +1
I had to return it because it wouldn't even start.
Further, this Mac Mini has a sloppy Bluetooth interface (courtesy of the Mac OS) and the range is poor.##sloppy -1, poor -1
Great deal on an amazing lap top!##Great +1, amazing +1
If you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the start menu will automatically come up.
Best money I ever spent.##Best +1
My only gripe would be the need to add more RAM.
But I didn't want to spend another thousand on a laptop since my work already provides me with a PC.
Fine if you have a touch screen.
can never go wrong with apple products.
