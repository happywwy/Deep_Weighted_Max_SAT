Some of the food is clearly oriented toward foodies (like me) so if your not a foodie (nothing wrong with that)- head over to McDonalds or some Ruby Tuesday and have at it!

I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent.##excellent - FOOD#QUALITY +1,excellent - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS +1,
However, the value and service are both severely lacking.##lacking - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,lacking - RESTAURANT#PRICES -1,
Portions contain less fish than one would expect, particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in NYC (Masa excluded, of course).
Furthermore, while the fish is unquestionably fresh, rolls tend to be inexplicably bland.##fresh - FOOD#QUALITY +1,bland - FOOD#QUALITY -1,
The service ranges from mediocre to offensive.##mediocre to offensive - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
On a recent trip, our waiter was extremely dismissive, while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby.##dismissive - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
We were then charged for their most expensive sake ($20+ per serving) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price.##expensive - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
But Im sure this was just an honest mistake...
Freshest sushi  – I love this restaurant.##Freshest - FOOD#QUALITY +1,love - RESTAURANT#GENERAL +1,

Took forever to get our order taken, water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention.

NOT THE PLACE IT ONCE WAS
– It is sad to see a place that was once "THE" place to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch, now be the place that is a big "DONT BOTHER."
The food is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) prices have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).##downsizing - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS -1,worst - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,gone up - FOOD#PRICES -1,
What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment.##worst - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
This establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS "DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES" hosted by Guy Fieri, in which Schooner or Later was subject of.##decline - RESTAURANT#GENERAL -1,
Perhaps now, Scooner or Later falls into the "Dive" category.
This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat.##sad - RESTAURANT#GENERAL -1,

I'm a born and bred Southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening.
Well, I guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management  to pay a visit to Tutta Bella in Columbia City for some tips.

COMPLETELY OVER RATED!##OVER RATED - RESTAURANT#GENERAL -1,
I will have to do more research before checking out new places based on Diners, drive-ins and dives reviews.
I noice most reviews mention the bad service.
The food was ok, but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.##ok - FOOD#QUALITY +1,poor - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,cold - FOOD#QUALITY -1,
Even then, the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items.##correct - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,
We had a very hard time getting the waitress' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager.##hard - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
As it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20% discount on our bill.##dismissive - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
When the bill came, he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks.
It was clear he didn’t really care.
With so many great breakfast/lunch places in So Cal, this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit.
AVOID THE PLACE##AVOID - RESTAURANT#GENERAL -1,
– Save yourself the waste of time & DO NOT visit.
I made my 1st trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online.
When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible!##cozy - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,horrible - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
I waited for 10-15 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again.
After sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes I left.
I went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that doesn't work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link.##deceptive - RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS -1,
I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago.
After telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar.
After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she'd be right with us.
We left without ever getting service.
As of writing this I just tried their give away a link again & it still doesn't work.
There are so many better places to visit!

best chinese food i have tasted in a long time##best - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
– we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night.
there was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area.
You can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing.##pleasant - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,
the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning.##nice - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,good - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up.
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese.##nice - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,courteous - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,
we ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food.
First off, the food came fast and all together :) i like that... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other.##fast - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,
so about the prawns, they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter... soooo good... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.##fresh - FOOD#QUALITY +1,good - FOOD#QUALITY +1,crunchy - FOOD#QUALITY +1,tasty - FOOD#QUALITY +1,

every month if possible.
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose.
Chintzy portions##Chintzy - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS -1,
– The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).##perfectly good - FOOD#QUALITY +1,moderately - RESTAURANT#PRICES -1,larger - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS +1,
We easily spent more than $40 per person (not including alcohol) and were still hungry.
I'm astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $$$ rather than $$$$.##astonished - RESTAURANT#PRICES -1,
Terrible service, food ok, pricey##Terrible - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,ok - FOOD#QUALITY +1,pricey - RESTAURANT#PRICES -1,
– This past weekend had great weather for San Francisco standards.
So for the 'after beach excursion', we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to Park Chalet.
The restaurant was busy, however there were a few tables open.
We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it'd be a 30 minute wait.nt of the building (where the murals and artifacts are).
So here we are, my wife, NUM year old daughter and I trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building (where the murals and artifacts are)
30 minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off.
We went back to the restaurant and low and behold, we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago!!
Logic behind that?
None that I can think of.
We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers, the food didn't arrive until 45 minutes later...WITH OUR MAIN COURSE.
Um so now what are appetizers for???
Oh I forgot to mention that they don't have bread service.
Its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag.
My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water (she had a sore throat) and I guess that since it was only water, it wasn't a priority for them to actually bring it.
In other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their 'service scale'.
Food wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.##ok - FOOD#QUALITY +1,pricey - RESTAURANT#PRICES -1,fancy - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,
The upside of the restaurant?
If I needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or Golden Gate park.
Its great if you spent the day there and didn't want to drive to eat.##great - LOCATION#GENERAL +1,
Parking is reasonably good, they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby.##good - RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS +1,
Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides.##plus - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,
I'd hate for tourists to go to Park Chalet and think that this is how all San Francisco restaurants are like.
Always good.##good - RESTAURANT#GENERAL +1,

While this diner had reasonably good food, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.##good - FOOD#QUALITY +1,lack of - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
As part of a small party of four, our food was dropped off without comment;
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.
When we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.
After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant.
A brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been "blown off" would be an understatement.##disappointment - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
The manager continually interrupted with "Is there anything else I can do for you?", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience.##disappointment - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name.
In short, Schooner or Later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.
Next time we will go somewhere else, or try other restaurants close by like Mimi's Cafe and Claim Jumper.

We were quickly seated and requested the special dinner, which came with: 1) Shellfish and Shrimp appetizer or Caesar Salad, 2) 9 oz steak (with a single potato chip), and 3) homemade donut holes.

It wasn't the freshest seafood ever, but the taste and presentation was OK.##OK - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS +1,freshest - FOOD#QUALITY +1,OK - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
Before the steak came, the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested I pick something from the menu.
I picked the asparagus, which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared.##incredible - FOOD#QUALITY +1,perfectly prepared - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
It was steamed and tossed with garlic.

The steak was done to my exact liking (medium rare) and was nice and juicy.##liking - FOOD#QUALITY +1,nice - FOOD#QUALITY +1,juicy - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.##indistinguishable - FOOD#QUALITY -1,
Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak.
My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ?MSG? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant.##dry - FOOD#QUALITY -1,
Finally, the homemade donut holes were served for desert.
They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.##light - FOOD#QUALITY +1,not-too-sweet - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.##perfect - FOOD#QUALITY +1,

Our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times.
Should check-up on us more frequently, don't you think?
Late night dinning with exeptional food.##exeptional - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
– I didn't want to go there because of the reviews and prices I saw on the internet.
That was the last night in Vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing - so we walked in the check the place.
We were seated right away, the table was private and nice.##right away - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,private - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,nice - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,

I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd.##odd - RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS -1,
The bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.##small - RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS -1,
There were 3 bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink.
I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom.##ackward - RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS -1,

- Mediocre Service/Quality##Mediocre - SERVICE#GENERAL -1,
– This review is for the Southglen location which is not listed in Citysearch:  I wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but Snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service, so this review as well as the other negative ones for their Larimer location will go unaddressed.
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.##excellent - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,sophisticated - AMBIENCE#GENERAL +1,high brow - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS -1,overpriced - RESTAURANT#PRICES -1,
To start off, approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $3.
They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.
I should have just asked for the check when I saw that; but their menu was so unique that I continued.##unique - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS +1,
The pancakes were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6" pancakes (one of them was more like 5") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well over-priced.##inventive - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS +1,over-priced - FOOD#PRICES -1,
The pancakes should be larger (at least 8") to justify the expense even with the unique offerings.##larger - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS +1,
The flavors were good but I have had far better pancakes at a German pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger.
On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the meal all together.
I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue.##frustrated - FOOD#QUALITY -1,
To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was.
In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).
This was 2 times what the same meal would have cost at Le Peep.
Snooze provided an inventive pancake offering, but Le Peep would have provided better service and quality.

– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray's Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.##pleased - RESTAURANT#GENERAL +1,
Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.##gorgeous - LOCATION#GENERAL +1,
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray's!##happy surprise - LOCATION#GENERAL +1,
To start things off, our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order.##quickly - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.##beautiful - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS +1,enormous - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS +1,fantastic - FOOD#QUALITY +1,tasty - FOOD#QUALITY +1,
For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.##enjoyed - FOOD#QUALITY +1,enjoyed - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS +1,
The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).##tasty - FOOD#QUALITY +1,unique - FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS +1,

Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that Ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?##attentive - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,
Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.##delightful - RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS +1,
Given that Ray's is a seafood restaurant...well, you get the idea...
All considered, I have to say that Ray's Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution.##deserving - RESTAURANT#GENERAL +1,
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one.##wonderful - SERVICE#GENERAL +1,wonderful - FOOD#QUALITY +1,positive - RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS +1,
