Frankly, the chinese food here is something I can make better at home.
There was only one waiter for the whole restaurant upstairs.

Also, the chick peas with shrimp appetizer is divine.##divine +1

This place is Italian, not French.
After so many great reviews here, my bf and I went to Esca to celebrate my birthday last nite.
While their kitchen food is delicious, their Sushi is out of this world.##delicious +1, out of this world +1
There was a heat problem to boot, so it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant -- we had to request to uncheck our coats!
everything is scrumptious, from the excellent service by cute waitresses, to the extremely lush atmosphere.##scrumptious +1, excellent +1, cute +1, lush +1

personally i say save your money.
In addition to great hot dogs, DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature, in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins, a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham.##great +1, wonderful +1, great +1, delicious +1
Believe me, they live up to the name.
Well, it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks, and then tells us to chill out.##graceless -1, rude -1
Not only is the service great, but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable.##great +1, easy +1, romantic +1, comfortable +1
When the dish arrived it was blazing with green chillis, definitely not edible by a human.##edible +1
The absolute worst service I've ever experienced and the food was below average (when they actually gave people the meals they ordered).##worst -1, below average -1
It's about $7 for lunch and they have take-out or dine-in.

We'll definitly be back again!
This is the best Italian restaurant in the city.##best +1

If this restaurant was in Manhattan, I would definitely go more often.

When it came time to take the order the waiter gave us a hard time, walked away then came back with a paper and pen for us to write down what we wanted ... excuse me but isn't that his job???
One of my Fav spots in the city.
Over priced, overrated ... stay away!##Over priced -1, overrated -1
Do not go to this restaurant.

This is a real gem of a place.
I think this a a wonderful place.##wonderful +1
First walking in the place seemed to have great ambience.##great +1
I went to Kitchenette this weekend for brunch.
This place doesn't get the publicity that Sylvias Soul Food restaurant does, but it should.
Just because P Diddy had a party at Butter doesn't mean we should be automatically impressed.
Even for two very hungry people there is plenty of food left to be taken home (it reheats really well also).##plenty +1
Like I said, Nick and Joe's may not be everyone's favorite, but it's mine.##favorite +1
The help was extremely nice and did not rush us.##nice +1
Then they somehow made a dry and burnt crust, around a raw and cold inside.##dry -1, burnt -1
It's just good food, nothing more and that's all we want!##good +1
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHERS ON THE BLOCK WERE LIKE BUT WE WERE PLEASED WITH OUR CHOICE.##PLEASED +1

I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews, but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two sales people.##love +1, RUDE -1

Not too much so, but enough that there's a great scene.##great +1
You feel like you made it to New York when you eat here.
We'd walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a Monday night.
SUM IT: don't read the '10's' reviews, try it to judge for yourself so you won't have as hi expectations, then you'll be sure to enjoy it.
We went there, no one greeted us.
Dug the blue bar area too.
We spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left.

Menus feature seasonal picks, like sweet corn-foie gras brulee.
Innovations are just as assured, from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon, beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce.
And these are not small, wimpy fast food type burgers - these are real, full sized patties.##full sized +1

They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak (I tried them ALL).
Not only was the sushi fresh, they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy (try the duck!##fresh +1, happy +1
good variety but nothing surprising.##good +1, nothing surprising -1
After I paid for my purchase, I noticed they had not given me utensils so I could eat my pie.
Likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then Nick and Joe's may not be your favorite.
It's always quiet because it's awful.##awful -1
No green beans, no egg, no anchovy dressing, no nicoise olives, no red onion.
Build a meal with side orders like Amazin Greens salads, Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix.
Thick fries, meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool, ultra-thick chocolate Frosty.##cool +1, ultra-thick +1
I always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu.
Good cake BUT: it was not the best cake i've ever had, and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees.##Good +1, best +1, worth +1, indifferent -1, overworked -1
The closest that I got was the Cherry Marscapone, but they were out of it that day.
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer, a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce, while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour.##evident +1, delectable +1, surprisingly sophisticated +1, fresh +1
It doesn't look like much on the outside, but the minute you walk inside, it's a whole other atmosphere.
I have to say the place was awesome.##awesome +1
The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin.##thin -1
We requested they re-slice the sushi, and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes.
The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.##below -1, horrible -1, rowdy -1, loud-mouthed -1, bad -1
If you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop by for a great meal.##great +1
Unfortunately, with our show tickets, we didn't have time to sample any desserts.
The restaurant could use a little paint, but all in all a great sushi place!##great +1
Make more tables - perhaps a rooftop bar?
The decoration was feeling like we was on the Cairo, actually the street is part of that adventure.
Although small, it has beautiful ambience, excellent food (the catfish is delicious - if ya don't mind it a lil salty) and attentive service.##small -1, beautiful +1, excellent +1, delicious +1, attentive +1
I didn't go there for food so I can't comment.
My friends and I go once a week (minimum, we live in the area) and everytime can't resist walking out ready to burst.
Stick to the items the place does best, brisket, ribs, wings, cajun shrimp is good, not great.##best +1, good +1, great +1
Hip boutiques and bars on Ludlow add to the artsy, laid-back atmosphere at this Israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint.##artsy +1, laid-back +1
Young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day, while chic, art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night.
Bring your date and a bottle of wine!
Not only is this the best Thai restaurant I have been to, but it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine.##best +1, favorite +1
Don't be put off by another reviewers extremely negative review.
My Chelsea's impressive and creative menu includes modern, Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean, Jap style hamburger steak, spicy cod roe spaghetti, black cod with miso base, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few.##impressive +1, creative +1, modern +1
His food is excellent (and not expensive by NYC standards - no entrees over $30, most appetizers $12 to 14).##excellent +1, expensive -1
The food is consistant and good but how it got name Best Diner In Manhattan is beyond me.##consistant +1, good +1
The pasta primavera was outstanding as well, lots of fresh veggies.##outstanding +1
don't get me wrong - sushi was good, just not fantastic.##good +1, fantastic +1

Had dinner here on a Friday and the food was great.##great +1
We recently spent New Year's Eve at the restaurant, and had a great experience, from the wine to the dessert menu.##great +1
Highly recommended ...  As stated, I haven't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place; also, the bar looks nice.##recommended +1, relaxing +1, nice +1
The ambiance was fine, a little loud but still nice and romantic.##fine +1, loud -1, nice +1, romantic +1
but, the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers (nice non-sushi selection).##good +1, free +1, nice +1
It took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 courses.
Who said go when the place is quiet during the day?
Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size.##busy -1
I was on jury duty, rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade.##great +1, awesome +1
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine.##good +1, simple +1, classic +1
Very nice touch that very much fits the place.##nice +1
However, there is just something so great about being outdoors, in great landscaping, enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile.##great +1, great +1, enjoying +1, worthwhile +1
We were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor.##promptly +1
If you are here as a pre-show meal, hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location.
A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while I was there.##good +1, great +1
The comments about fried foods is correct (below) but the other dishes, including the lamb entree and many of the salads avocado shrimp were quite good.##good +1
It's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book.
Slow service, but when you're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20, who really notices?##Slow -1
The sauce is excellent (very fresh) with dabs of real mozzarella.##excellent +1, fresh +1
Don't ever bother - the drinks were awful, but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining.##awful -1, worst -1
The room is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go.##plain -1
Prices even outside of restaurant week were great.##great +1
A small, outdoor eating area makes for a private, comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends.##private +1, comfortable +1
Before the place didn't call my attention.
And all the female servers are cute too, which is always nice.##cute +1, nice +1
The best dessert, a chocolate and peanut butter tart, isn't particularly Hawaiian, but it's a small world when it comes to sweets.##best +1
for an appetizer, their calamari is a winner.##winner +1
Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the service and food is always on the money.##favorite +1
After dinner I heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs.
But now that it's under new ownership and has been renovated, it looks great.##great +1
The room is a gorgeous, bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink.##gorgeous +1, perfect +1
Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here.
Two complaints - their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu.##stinks -1, nice +1
I don't remember what we had; nothing was memorable.
It is bland and nothing extraordinary.##bland -1, nothing extraordinary -1 
I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party.##impressed +1, prompt +1, friendly +1
The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad.##nondescript -1
Every time I visit NYC, I come here.
I've been coming here regularly since it opened, about 2 years ago.
The atmosphere takes you to that place, the place many dream of.
several times and put up with the waiters' bad manners, knowing that their job isn't easy.##bad -1
The service is great (maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention), the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good...##great +1, excellent +1, good +1
We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this wasn't a place we'd return to.
They are served on Focacchia bread and are to die for.##die for +1
While the smoothies are a little big for me, the fresh juices are the best I have ever had!##big -1, best +1
The food is just OKAY, and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the paella, which is the only dish that's really good.##OKAY +1, worth +1, good +1
The guac is fresh, yet lacking flavor, we like to add our fresh salsa into it.##fresh +1, lacking -1
The new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.##creative +1, friendly +1
It' only open for lunch but the food is so good!##good +1
If you like seafood and/or Greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things.##like +1, love +1
" The menu includes pub fare -- burgers, steaks and shepherds pie -- and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as "vegetarians.
How can they survive serving mediocre food at exorbitant prices?!##mediocre -1, exorbitant -1
The food was mediocre and the service was severely slow.##mediocre -1, severely slow -1
i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the prices.##mediocre -1
I'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu!
I just had my first visit to this place and can't wait to go back and slowly work my way through the menu.
I asked repeatedly what the status of the meal was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude waiter.##rude -1, 
I stopped by for some brunch today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk.
Weekends can get crowded, but still highly recommended.##crowded -1, recommended +1
It gets very crowded so I would suggest that you get their early.##crowded -1
Sweet Irish bartender is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face.##Sweet +1
I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry - interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat.
Its good to go there for drinks if you don't want to get drunk because you'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad.##good +1, bad -1
Anyway, the owner was fake.##fake -1
Owner is pleasant and entertaining.##pleasant +1, entertaining +1
I have never in my life sent back food before, but I simply had to, and the waiter argued with me over this.
Although the restaurant itself is nice, I prefer not to go for the food.##nice +1
Creamy appetizers -- taramasalata, eggplant salad, and Greek yogurt with cucumber dill and garlic taste excellent when on warm pitas.##Creamy +1, excellent +1
